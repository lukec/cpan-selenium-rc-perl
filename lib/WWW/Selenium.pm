=head1 DESCRIPTION

Selenium Remote Control (SRC) is a test tool that allows you to write
automated web application UI tests in any programming language against
any HTTP website using any mainstream JavaScript-enabled browser.  SRC
provides a Selenium Server, which can automatically start/stop/control
any supported browser. It works by using Selenium Core, a pure-HTML+JS
library that performs automated tasks in JavaScript; the Selenium
Server communicates directly with the browser using AJAX
(XmlHttpRequest).

L<http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc/>

This module sends commands directly to the Server using simple HTTP
GET/POST requests.  Using this module together with the Selenium
Server, you can automatically control any supported browser.

To use this module, you need to have already downloaded and started
the Selenium Server.  (The Selenium Server is a Java application.)

#Defines an object that runs Selenium commands.

=head2 Element Locators

Element Locators tell Selenium which HTML element a command refers to.The format of a locator is:

=over

=item I<locatorType>B<=>I<argument>

=back

We support the following strategies for locating elements:

=over

=item *

B<identifier>=I<id>: Select the element with the specified @id attribute. If no match isfound, select the first element whose @name attribute is I<id>.(This is normally the default; see below.)

=item *

B<id>=I<id>:Select the element with the specified @id attribute.

=item *

B<name>=I<name>:Select the first element with the specified @name attribute.

=over

=item *

username

=item *

name=username

=back

The name may optionally be followed by one or more I<element-filters>, separated from the name by whitespace.  If the I<filterType> is not specified, B<value> is assumed.

=over

=item *

name=flavour value=chocolate

=back

=item *

B<dom>=I<javascriptExpression>: Find an element by evaluating the specified string.  This allows you to traverse the HTML Document ObjectModel using JavaScript.  Note that you must not return a value in this string; simply make it the last expression in the block.

=over

=item *

dom=document.forms['myForm'].myDropdown

=item *

dom=document.images[56]

=item *

dom=function foo() { return document.links[1]; }; foo();

=back

=item *

B<xpath>=I<xpathExpression>: Locate an element using an XPath expression.

=over

=item *

xpath=//img[@alt='The image alt text']

=item *

xpath=//table[@id='table1']//tr[4]/td[2]

=item *

xpath=//a[contains(@href,'#id1')]

=item *

xpath=//a[contains(@href,'#id1')]/@class

=item *

xpath=(//table[@class='stylee'])//th[text()='theHeaderText']/../td

=item *

xpath=//input[@name='name2' and @value='yes']

=item *

xpath=//*[text()="right"]

=back

=item *

B<link>=I<textPattern>:Select the link (anchor) element which contains text matching thespecified I<pattern>.

=over

=item *

link=The link text

=back

=item *

B<css>=I<cssSelectorSyntax>:Select the element using css selectors. Please refer to http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html (CSS2 selectors), http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/ (CSS3 selectors) for more information. You can also check the TestCssLocators test in the selenium test suite for an example of usage, which is included in the downloaded selenium core package.

=over

=item *

css=a[href="#id3"]

=item *

css=span#firstChild + span

=back

Currently the css selector locator supports all css1, css2 and css3 selectors except namespace in css3, some pseudo classes(:nth-of-type, :nth-last-of-type, :first-of-type, :last-of-type, :only-of-type, :visited, :hover, :active, :focus, :indeterminate) and pseudo elements(::first-line, ::first-letter, ::selection, ::before, ::after).

=item *

B<ui>=I<uiSpecifierString>:Locate an element by resolving the UI specifier string to another locator, and evaluating it. See the http://svn.openqa.org/fisheye/browse/~raw,r=trunk/selenium/trunk/src/main/resources/core/scripts/ui-doc.html (Selenium UI-Element Reference) for more details.

=over

=item *

ui=loginPages::loginButton()

=item *

ui=settingsPages::toggle(label=Hide Email)

=item *

ui=forumPages::postBody(index=2)//a[2]

=back

=back

Without an explicit locator prefix, Selenium uses the following defaultstrategies:

=over

=item *

B<dom>, for locators starting with "document."

=item *

B<xpath>, for locators starting with "//"

=item *

B<identifier>, otherwise

=back

=head2 Element Filters

Element filters can be used with a locator to refine a list of candidate elements.  They are currently used only in the 'name' element-locator.

Filters look much like locators, ie.

=over

=item I<filterType>B<=>I<argument>

=back

Supported element-filters are:

=over

=item B<value=>I<valuePattern>

Matches elements based on their values.  This is particularly useful for refining a list of similarly-named toggle-buttons.

=item B<index=>I<index>

Selects a single element based on its position in the list (offset from zero).

=back

=head2 String-match Patterns

Various Pattern syntaxes are available for matching string values:

=over

=item *

B<glob:>I<pattern>:Match a string against a "glob" (aka "wildmat") pattern. "Glob" is akind of limited regular-expression syntax typically used in command-lineshells. In a glob pattern, "*" represents any sequence of characters, and "?"represents any single character. Glob patterns match against the entirestring.

=item *

B<regexp:>I<regexp>:Match a string using a regular-expression. The full power of JavaScriptregular-expressions is available.

=item *

B<regexpi:>I<regexpi>:Match a string using a case-insensitive regular-expression.

=item *

B<exact:>I<string>:Match a string exactly, verbatim, without any of that fancy wildcardstuff.

=back

If no pattern prefix is specified, Selenium assumes that it's a "glob"pattern.

For commands that return multiple values (such as verifySelectOptions),the string being matched is a comma-separated list of the return values,where both commas and backslashes in the values are backslash-escaped.When providing a pattern, the optional matching syntax (i.e. glob,regexp, etc.) is specified once, as usual, at the beginning of thepattern.

=cut

eval 'require Encode';
my $encode_present = !$@;
Encode->import('decode_utf8') if $encode_present;

=head2 METHODS

The following methods are available:

=over

=item $sel = WWW::Selenium-E<gt>new( %args )

Constructs a new C<WWW::Selenium> object, specifying a Selenium Server
host/port, a command to launch the browser, and a starting URL for the
browser.

Options:

=over

=item * C<host>

host is the host name on which the Selenium Server resides.

=item * C<port>

port is the port on which the Selenium Server is listening.

=item * C<browser_url>

browser_url is the starting URL including just a domain name.  We'll
start the browser pointing at the Selenium resources on this URL,
e.g. "http://www.google.com" would send the browser to
"http://www.google.com/selenium-server/SeleneseRunner.html"

=item * C<browser> or C<browser_start_command>

This is the command string used to launch the browser, e.g.
"*firefox", "*iexplore" or "/usr/bin/firefox"

This option may be any one of the following:

=over

=item * C<*firefox [absolute path]>

Automatically launch a new Firefox process using a custom Firefox
profile.
This profile will be automatically configured to use the Selenium
Server as a proxy and to have all annoying prompts
("save your password?" "forms are insecure" "make Firefox your default
browser?" disabled.  You may optionally specify
an absolute path to your firefox executable, or just say "*firefox".
If no absolute path is specified, we'll look for
firefox.exe in a default location (normally c:\program files\mozilla
firefox\firefox.exe), which you can override by
setting the Java system property C<firefoxDefaultPath> to the correct
path to Firefox.

=item * C<*iexplore [absolute path]>

Automatically launch a new Internet Explorer process using custom
Windows registry settings.
This process will be automatically configured to use the Selenium
Server as a proxy and to have all annoying prompts
("save your password?" "forms are insecure" "make Firefox your default
browser?" disabled.  You may optionally specify
an absolute path to your iexplore executable, or just say "*iexplore".
If no absolute path is specified, we'll look for
iexplore.exe in a default location (normally c:\program files\internet
explorer\iexplore.exe), which you can override by
setting the Java system property C<iexploreDefaultPath> to the correct
path to Internet Explorer.

=item * C</path/to/my/browser [other arguments]>

You may also simply specify the absolute path to your browser
executable, or use a relative path to your executable (which we'll try
to find on your path).  B<Warning:> If you
specify your own custom browser, it's up to you to configure it
correctly.  At a minimum, you'll need to configure your
browser to use the Selenium Server as a proxy, and disable all
browser-specific prompting.

=back

=item * C<auto_stop>

Defaults to true, and will attempt to close the browser if the object
goes out of scope and stop hasn't been called.

=item * C<keep_alive>

Number of connections LWP should cache. This is just a minor speed
improvement. Defaults to 5.

=item * C<http_method>>

Choose which HTTP method should be used for requests to the Selenium server.
Only GET and POST are supported.

=item $sel-E<gt>open_window($url, $window_id)

Opens a popup window (if a window with that ID isn't already open).After opening the window, you'll need to select it using the selectWindowcommand.
This command can also be a useful workaround for bug SEL-339.  In some cases, Selenium will be unable to intercept a call to window.open (if the call occurs during or before the "onLoad" event, for example).In those cases, you can force Selenium to notice the open window's name by using the Selenium openWindow command, usingan empty (blank) url, like this: openWindow("", "myFunnyWindow").

=over

=back

=cut

sub open_window {

}

=item $sel-E<gt>select_window($window_id)

Selects a popup window using a window locator; once a popup window has been selected, allcommands go to that window. To select the main window again, use nullas the target.
Window locators provide different ways of specifying the window object:by title, by internal JavaScript "name," or by JavaScript variable.

=over

=item *

B<title>=I<My Special Window>:Finds the window using the text that appears in the title bar.  Be careful;two windows can share the same title.  If that happens, this locator willjust pick one.

=item *

B<name>=I<myWindow>:Finds the window using its internal JavaScript "name" property.  This is the second parameter "windowName" passed to the JavaScript method window.open(url, windowName, windowFeatures, replaceFlag)(which Selenium intercepts).

=item *

B<var>=I<variableName>:Some pop-up windows are unnamed (anonymous), but are associated with a JavaScript variable name in the currentapplication window, e.g. "window.foo = window.open(url);".  In those cases, you can open the window using"var=foo".

=back

If no window locator prefix is provided, we'll try to guess what you mean like this:

1.) if windowID is null, (or the string "null") then it is assumed the user is referring to the original window instantiated by the browser).

2.) if the value of the "windowID" parameter is a JavaScript variable name in the current application window, then it is assumedthat this variable contains the return value from a call to the JavaScript window.open() method.

3.) Otherwise, selenium looks in a hash it maintains that maps string names to window "names".

4.) If I<that> fails, we'll try looping over all of the known windows to try to find the appropriate "title".Since "title" is not necessarily unique, this may have unexpected behavior.

If you're having trouble figuring out the name of a window that you want to manipulate, look at the Selenium log messageswhich identify the names of windows created via window.open (and therefore intercepted by Selenium).  You will see messageslike the following for each window as it is opened:

C<debug: window.open call intercepted; window ID (which you can use with selectWindow()) is "myNewWindow">

In some cases, Selenium will be unable to intercept a call to window.open (if the call occurs during or before the "onLoad" event, for example).(This is bug SEL-339.)  In those cases, you can force Selenium to notice the open window's name by using the Selenium openWindow command, usingan empty (blank) url, like this: openWindow("", "myFunnyWindow").

sub select_window {

=item $sel-E<gt>select_pop_up($window_id)

Simplifies the process of selecting a popup window (and does not offerfunctionality beyond what C<selectWindow()> already provides).

=over

=item *

If C<windowID> is either not specified, or specified as"null", the first non-top window is selected. The top window is the onethat would be selected by C<selectWindow()> without providing aC<windowID> . This should not be used when more than one popupwindow is in play.

=item *

Otherwise, the window will be looked up consideringC<windowID> as the following in order: 1) the "name" of thewindow, as specified to C<window.open()>; 2) a javascriptvariable which is a reference to a window; and 3) the title of thewindow. This is the same ordered lookup performed byC<selectWindow> .

To select the parent frame, use"relative=parent" as a locator; to select the top frame, use "relative=top".You can also select a frame by its 0-based index number; select the first frame with"index=0", or the third frame with "index=2".
You may also use a DOM expression to identify the frame you want directly,like this: C<dom=frames["main"].frames["subframe"]>

Selenium constantly keeps track of new pages loading, and sets a "newPageLoaded"flag when it first notices a page load.  Running any other Selenium command afterturns the flag to false.  Hence, if you want to wait for a page to load, you mustwait immediately after a Selenium command that caused a page-load.

Alsonote that specifying a domain that isn't a subset of the current domain will usually fail.Since there's no way to discover at runtime the original path and domain of a given cookie,we've added an option called 'recurse' to try all sub-domains of the current domain withall paths that are a subset of the current path.  Beware; this option can be slow.  Inbig-O notation, it operates in O(n*m) time, where n is the number of dots in the domainname and m is the number of slashes in the path.

=item $sel-E<gt>set_browser_log_level($log_level)

Sets the threshold for browser-side logging messages; log messages beneath this threshold will be discarded.Valid logLevel strings are: "debug", "info", "warn", "error" or "off".To see the browser logs, you need toeither show the log window in GUI mode, or enable browser-side logging in Selenium RC.

=over

=item $log_level is one of the following: "debug", "info", "warn", "error" or "off"

=item $sel-E<gt>run_script($script)

Creates a new "script" tag in the body of the current test window, and adds the specified text into the body of the command.  Scripts run inthis way can often be debugged more easily than scripts executed usingSelenium's "getEval" command.  Beware that JS exceptions thrown in these scripttags aren't managed by Selenium, so you should probably wrap your scriptin try/catch blocks if there is any chance that the script will throwan exception.

=over

=item $script is the JavaScript snippet to run

=cut

sub run_script {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->do_command("runScript", @_);
}

=item $sel-E<gt>add_location_strategy($strategy_name)

Defines a new function for Selenium to locate elements on the page.For example,if you define the strategy "foo", and someone runs click("foo=blah"), we'llrun your function, passing you the string "blah", and click on the element that your functionreturns, or throw an "Element not found" error if your function returns null.We'll pass three arguments to your function:

=over

=item *

locator: the string the user passed in

=item *

inWindow: the currently selected window

=item *

inDocument: the currently selected document

=back

The function must return null if the element can't be found.

=over

=item $strategy_name is the name of the strategy to define; this should use only   letters [a-zA-Z] with no spaces or other punctuation.

=item $sel-E<gt>capture_entire_page_screenshot($filename, $kwargs)

Saves the entire contents of the current window canvas to a PNG file.Contrast this with the captureScreenshot command, which captures thecontents of the OS viewport (i.e. whatever is currently being displayedon the monitor), and is implemented in the RC only. Currently this onlyworks in Firefox when running in chrome mode, and in IE non-HTA usingthe EXPERIMENTAL "Snapsie" utility. The Firefox implementation is mostlyborrowed from the Screengrab! Firefox extension. Please seehttp://www.screengrab.org and http://snapsie.sourceforge.net/ fordetails.

=over

=item $filename is the path to the file to persist the screenshot as. No filename extension will be appended by default.  Directories will not be created if they do not exist, and an exception will be thrown, possibly by native code.

=item $kwargs is a kwargs string that modifies the way the screenshot is captured. Example: "background=#CCFFDD". Currently valid options:

=over

=item background the background CSS for the HTML document. This may be useful to set for capturing screenshots of less-than-ideal layouts, for example where absolute positioning causes the calculation of the canvas dimension to fail and a black background is exposed (possibly obscuring black text).

sub capture_entire_page_screenshot {

=item $sel-E<gt>rollup($rollup_name, $kwargs)

Executes a command rollup, which is a series of commands with a uniquename, and optionally arguments that control the generation of the set ofcommands. If any one of the rolled-up commands fails, the rollup isconsidered to have failed. Rollups may also contain nested rollups.

=over

=item $rollup_name is the name of the rollup command

=item $kwargs is keyword arguments string that influences how the rollup expands into commands

sub rollup {
    my $self = shift;

=item $sel-E<gt>add_script($script_content, $script_tag_id)

Loads script content into a new script tag in the Selenium document. Thisdiffers from the runScript command in that runScript adds the script tagto the document of the AUT, not the Selenium document. The followingentities in the script content are replaced by the characters they represent: &lt; &gt; &amp;The corresponding remove command is removeScript.

=over

=item $script_content is the Javascript content of the script to add

=item $script_tag_id is (optional) the id of the new script tag. If specified, and an element with this id already exists, this operation will fail.

=cut

sub add_script {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->do_command("addScript", @_);

=item $sel-E<gt>remove_script($script_tag_id)

Removes a script tag from the Selenium document identified by the givenid. Does nothing if the referenced tag doesn't exist.

=over

=item $script_tag_id is the id of the script element to remove.

=cut

sub remove_script {

=item $sel-E<gt>use_xpath_library($library_name)

Allows choice of one of the available libraries.

=over

=item $library_name is name of the desired library Only the following three can be chosen:

=over

=item *

"ajaxslt" - Google's library


=item *

"javascript-xpath" - Cybozu Labs' faster library


=item *

"default" - The default library.  Currently the default library is "ajaxslt" .

=item $sel-E<gt>attach_file($field_locator, $file_locator)

Sets a file input (upload) field to the file listed in fileLocator

=over

=item $field_locator is an element locator

=item $file_locator is a URL pointing to the specified file. Before the file  can be set in the input field (fieldLocator), Selenium RC may need to transfer the file to the local machine before attaching the file in a web page form. This is common in selenium  grid configurations where the RC server driving the browser is not the same  machine that started the test. Supported Browsers: Firefox ("*chrome") only.

Downloads a screenshot of the browser current window canvas to a based 64 encoded PNG file. The I<entire> windows canvas is captured,including parts rendered outside of the current view port.Currently this only works in Mozilla and when running in chrome mode.

=over

=item $kwargs is A kwargs string that modifies the way the screenshot is captured. Example: "background=#CCFFDD".

=item $sel-E<gt>shut_down_selenium_server()

Kills the running Selenium Server and all browser sessions.  After you run this command, you will no longer be able to sendcommands to the server; you can't remotely start the server once it has been stopped.  Normallyyou should prefer to run the "stop" command, which terminates the current browser session, rather than shutting down the entire server.

=item $sel-E<gt>key_down_native($keycode)

Simulates a user pressing a key (without releasing it yet) by sending a native operating system keystroke.This function uses the java.awt.Robot class to send a keystroke; this more accurately simulates typinga key on the keyboard.  It does not honor settings from the shiftKeyDown, controlKeyDown, altKeyDown andmetaKeyDown commands, and does not target any particular HTML element.  To send a keystroke to a particularelement, focus on the element first before running this command.
