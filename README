=head1 NAME

Test::WWW::Selenium - Test applications using Selenium Remote Control

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Test::WWW::Selenium is a subclass of L<WWW::Selenium> that provides
convenient testing functions.

    use Test::More tests => 5;
    use Test::WWW::Selenium;

    # Parameters are passed through to WWW::Selenium
    my $sel = Test::WWW::Selenium->new( host => "localhost",
                                        port => 4444,
                                        browser => "*firefox",
                                        browser_url => "http://www.google.com",
                                        default_names => 1,
                                        error_callback => sub { ... },
                                      );

    # use special test wrappers around WWW::Selenium commands:
    $sel->open_ok("http://www.google.com", undef, "fetched G's site alright");
    $sel->type_ok( "q", "hello world");
    $sel->click_ok("btnG");
    $sel->wait_for_page_to_load_ok(5000);
    $sel->title_like(qr/Google Search/);
    $sel->error_callback(sub {...});

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

To use this module, you need to have already downloaded and started the
Selenium Server.  (The Selenium Server is a Java application.)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a L<WWW::Selenium> subclass providing some methods
useful for writing tests. For each Selenium command (open, click,
type, ...) there is a corresponding C<< <command>_ok >> method that
checks the return value (open_ok, click_ok, type_ok).

For each Selenium getter (get_title, ...) there are four autogenerated
methods (C<< <getter>_is >>, C<< <getter>_isnt >>, C<< <getter>_like >>,
C<< <getter>_unlike >>) to check the value of the attribute.

By calling the constructor with C<default_names> set to a true value your
tests will be given a reasonable name should you choose not to provide
one of your own.  The test name should always be the third argument.

=head1 ADDITIONAL METHODS

Test::WWW::Selenium also provides some other handy testing functions
that wrap L<WWW::Selenium> commands:

=item get_location

Returns the relative location of the current page.  Works with
_is, _like, ... methods.

=item error_callback

Sets the method to use when a corresponding selenium test is called and fails.
For example if you call text_like(...) and it fails the sub defined in the
error_callback will be called. This allows you to perform various tasks to
obtain additional details that occured when obtianing the error. If this is
set to undef then the callback will not be issued.

=over 4

=item $sel-E<gt>debug()

Starts an interactive shell to pass commands to Selenium.

Commands are run against the selenium object, so you just need to type:

=item eg: click("link=edit")
