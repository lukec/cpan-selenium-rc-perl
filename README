Test-WWW-Selenium is a perl driver and test library for Selenium Remote
Control (SRC).  You will need to setup a Selenium Server that can launch
browsers.

Selenium Remote Control (SRC) is a test tool that allows you to write
automated web application UI tests in any programming language against
any HTTP website using any mainstream JavaScript-enabled browser.  SRC
provides a Selenium Server, which can automatically start/stop/control
any supported browser. It works by using Selenium Core, a pure-HTML+JS
library that performs automated tasks in JavaScript; the Selenium
Server communicates directly with the browser using AJAX (XmlHttpRe-
quest).

This module sends commands directly to the Server using simple HTTP
GET/POST requests.  Using this module together with the Selenium
Server, you can automatically control any supported browser.

To use this module, you need to have already downloaded and started the
Selenium Server.  (The Selenium Server is a Java application.)

The Selenium Server is available here:

  http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc/

or on CPAN in the Alien-SeleniumRC package:

  http://search.cpan.org/dist/Alien-SeleniumRC

To install:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Once installed, your test script will look something like this:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Test::More tests => 4;
    use Test::WWW::Selenium;

    my $sel = Test::WWW::Selenium->new( host => "localhost",    # where selenium-server is running
                                        browser => "*firefox",  # browser to server should launch
                                        browser_url => "http://your.site");

    $sel->open("http://your.site");
    $sel->title_is('Super Cool Mega Site!');
    $sel->text_is('todays_awesomeness', '100');
    $sel->text_like('status', qr/returned 42 results/);
